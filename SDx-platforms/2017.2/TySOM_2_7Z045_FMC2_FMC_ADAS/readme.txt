Default resolutions for cameras are:
960x540 - cameras 0-3
1280x720 - camera 4

To set all cameras resolutions to 1280x720 use 'devicetree_HD_camera.dtb' instead of 'devicetree.dtb'. Remember to change name of devicetree to "devicetree.dtb'.

These devicetree files can be found in TySOM_2_7Z045_FMC2_FMC_ADAS/sw/config0_0/image directory.
